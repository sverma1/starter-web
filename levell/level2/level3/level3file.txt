Academics

Graduating from college is as important an achievement as winning on the field.  We embrace our role in providing student-athletes the skills for what comes next in life.  It’s our commitment – and our responsibility – to give young people opportunities to learn, play and succeed.

We do so in part by setting standards to make sure incoming student-athletes are prepared for college coursework, and by tracking their progress toward a degree once they’re on campus.
